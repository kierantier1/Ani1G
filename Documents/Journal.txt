-Purpose:  to implement movement into the animation
-ArrayOutofbounds error:  because keycode is reading the arrow keys as well, fixed.
-It moves, but animation is static right now.  Working on co-ordinating
-//Theory:  Use the final position - original position to find direction//
-Edit:  don't do this.  Use the keys, dum-dum

-Starting to work on Animation again
-It seems to be stuck on the first line of sprites in the sheet.  Not sure how to fix it.  Working on it
-Hypothesis confirmed. nPos remains the same, while nFrame moves from 0-7
-nPos is now manipulated through the arrow keys, but only works for Up, right, left and down
